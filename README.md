# Solar Agribot 

The Solar Agribot Project was the Major Qualifying Project for my Bachlors Degrees in Computer Science & Electrical and Computer Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The project was started in late August of 2022 and ended in May of 2023. 
In this repository lives all of the code that was written. 

## How to Use
For future project groups or anyone interested please first fork the repository then clone that one.
